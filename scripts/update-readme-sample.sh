=== Village Layout Test ===
Generated village with modular building designs:

EOF

# Add the map sample
echo "$MAP_SAMPLE" >> "$TEMP_SAMPLE"

# Add the features section
cat >> "$TEMP_SAMPLE" <<'EOF'

Features:
- Standardized # walls for consistent building structure
- Unicode interior symbols: üèõ (libraries), ‚åÇ (cottages), ‚ó¶ (districts), ‚ñ≤ (warehouses)
- Multiple designs per building type with size-based selection
- Modular system supporting easy addition of new building designs
- Deterministic layout based on file structure
